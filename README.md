Project 1 Submission 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
// The project was for Chada Tech. The project aimed to create a clock that displayed in both 12-hour and 24-hour format. The code converts the 12-hour format to 24-hour format, and further allows the user to edit the hours, minutes and seconds of the clock. The clock is set to reset once the clock hits midnight as well. 
What did you do particularly well?
//I feel that I was able to use switch cases well within this program. For me, it made reading and compiling the code much easier, as well as allowing me to see where mistakes might hvae been made.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
// In my honest opinion, I feel that my method setting was a bit messy and could be improved in further projects. Furthermore, continuing to write as little as possible within the main function would improve the code. This would allow my code to compiler faster, and cleaner methods leave little room for error. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
//Writing the methods for the program. Beginning is always the hardest part for me. My switch case was also messed up when I was writing the code earlier in the program. I consulted outside resources, such as Matt Parker on youtube, and tutoring as well. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think using multiple files when writing programs will be the most transferable skill. I believe that using inheritance, encapsulation, etc. will also be transferrable. These are basic skills in programming and writing code that are very important. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program maintainable by writing my program within multiple files. This allowed for easier compiling and debugging. I further wrote as little code in main as possible.
